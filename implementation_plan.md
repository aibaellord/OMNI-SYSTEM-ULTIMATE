- Integration with quantum field theory for consciousness emergence

### 2. Infinity Memory Vault (Priority #2)
**Why Next:** Provides unlimited storage capacity required by consciousness systems and reality simulators.

### 3. Reality Mirror Simulator (Priority #3)
**Why Next:** Depends on consciousness nexus for simulation control and memory vault for state storage.

### 4. Echo Recorder (Priority #4)
**Why Next:** Requires simulation capabilities for echo analysis and consciousness nexus for pattern recognition.

### 5. Fractal Reality Weaver (Priority #5)
**Why Last:** Integrates all previous systems for complete reality manipulation.
